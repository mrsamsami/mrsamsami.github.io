                 We try to develop agents that understand and reason about physics and simple classical mechanics in 2D environments. Specifically, by using causal inference tools and reinforcement learning, we try to propose methods to learn representations capturing the invariant properties of a particular set of environments.

        <h2>Skills and Interests</h2>
      </header>
	  <p class="content">
	  My main research interest lies in understanding how intelligence is grounded in computation and how we can implement it in neural systems. I am passionate about studying computational models of learning, perception, language, and reasoning, particularly in the framework of machine learning.
	  </br>
	  I am skilled in developing deep learning and reinforcement learning projects, and have experience in programming in languages like Python, C++, and Java. I am also interested in understanding intelligence in the framework of Bayesian reasoning and probabilistic models.	  </br>
	  Apart from computer science and mathematics, I have curiosity and concern about philosophy, politics, economics, and social science. I am interested in swimming, movies, and music.
