          </header>
          <p>
		  I'm M.Sc. student at Montreal institute for learning algorithms (Mila) and École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) and co-founder at Daftar-e-Hokmrani. I recently finished my internship in École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (ÉPFL) and worked in MetoData company as a data scientist. Lately, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the Sharif University of Technology.
</br>
		  I am enthusiastic about understanding how intelligence is grounded in computation, how we can implement it in neural systems, and developing agents capable of reasoning in complex situations. Moreover, I am interested in bringing artificial intelligence to policymaking, economics, and social science.

                 We try to develop agents that understand and reason about physics and simple classical mechanics in 2D environments. Specifically, by using causal inference tools and reinforcement learning, we try to propose methods to learn representations capturing the invariant properties of a particular set of environments.

	  <p class="content">
	  I am passionate about studying computational models of learning, perception, language, and reasoning, particularly in the framework of machine learning. 
	  Therefore, I explore AI from various perspectives such as philosophy of mind, psychology, cognitive science, and computer science to assess the notions of intelligence and learn the impacts of AI.
	  </br>
	  I am skilled in developing deep learning and reinforcement learning projects, and have experience in programming in languages like Python, C++, and Java. I am also interested in understanding intelligence in the framework of Bayesian reasoning and probabilistic models.	  </br>
	  Apart from computer science and mathematics, I have curiosity and concern about philosophy, politics, economics, and social science. I am interested in swimming, movies, and music (I play guitar 🎸).
