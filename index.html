            <h2>I'm Mohammad Reza</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            As an M.Sc. student at Mila - Québec AI Institute and Université de Montréal, I currently hold a visiting researcher position at ServiceNow. 
            My past experience includes an internship at EPFL and AI research roles at companies. 
            I've earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from Sharif University of Technology.
          </br>
            My scientific interests center on understanding how intelligence is grounded in computation, specifically developing agents capable of reasoning in complex situations.
            I'm also dedicated to bringing AI solutions to real-world decision-making problems and collaborate with startups seeking to integrate AI into their systems.  
          </br>    
            I am not committed to or against the development of artificial general intelligence for its own sake, but rather envision the creation of machines that can assist us in addressing and solving our problems.
            Furthermore, I strongly advocate for an active exploration of the ways in which AI shifts power dynamics and fundamentally transforms our world.

              We have implemented the algorithm from the paper "Learning composable hierarchical control with multiplicative compositional policies". The codebase for this algorithm does not already exist. This paper introduces an algorithm that learns a set of primitives for control using pretraining tasks and then finetunes on the downstream task. The primitives are combined using a weighting mechanism in which multiple primitives can be active at the same time, allowing complex behaviors to emerge. We tested the algorithm on our version of the Ant environment.

                 We try to develop agents that understand and reason about physics and simple classical mechanics in 2D environments. Specifically, by using causal inference tools and reinforcement learning, we try to propose methods to learn representations capturing the invariant properties of a particular set of environments.

	  I am passionate about studying computational models of learning, perception, language, and reasoning, particularly in the framework of machine learning. 
	  Therefore, I explore AI from various perspectives such as philosophy of mind, psychology, cognitive science, and computer science to assess the notions of intelligence and learn the impacts of AI.
	  </br>
	  I am skilled in developing deep learning and reinforcement learning projects, and have experience in programming in languages like Python, C++, and Java. I am also interested in understanding intelligence in the framework of Bayesian reasoning and probabilistic models.	  </br>
	  Apart from computer science and mathematics, I have curiosity and concern about philosophy, politics, economics, and social science. I am interested in swimming, movies, and music (I play guitar 🎸).
